function [Rot ,Pot] = fwdkin_Dofbot (q)
% FWDKIN_DOFBOT Computes the end effector position and orientation relative
%to the base frame for Yahboom â€™s Dofbot manipulator using the product of
% exponentials approach
% Input :
% q: 5x1 vector of joint angles in degrees
%
% Output :
% Rot: The 3x3 rotation matrix describing the relative orientation of
% the end effector frame to the base frame (R_ {0T})
% Pot: The 3x1 vector describing the position of the end effector
% relative to the base , where the first element is the position
% along the base frame x-axis , the second element is the position
% along the base frame y-axis , and the third element is the
% position along the base frame z- axis (P_ {0T})

l5 = 0.05457; % servo 5 to gripper

%% set up the rotation matrices between subsequent frames
% for MATLAB, an element of a vector is extracted using parentheses

% (in Python indexing starts at 0)

%Pot is a combination of the position vectors . Each vector must be
% represented in the base frame before addition . This is achieved using the
% rotation matrices .
